    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given experimental data on the bounce height of differently sized bouncy balls, find a line that best fits the size-vs-bounceheight data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Linear Regression_ is when you have a group of points on a graph, and you find a line that approximately resembles that group of points. A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the _error_, or the distance from each point to the line. A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this a line of _best fit_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aproach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will approximate the line of best fit through a brute-force linear regression, simply trying different m & b values in y=mx+b, and recording those that result in the least error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We recognize that this is a pretty mediocre approach from a data science perspective. The purpose of this project has more to do with a basic data science work flow, as well as python / jupyter proficiency."
