## Brute Force Linear Regression

Given experimental data on the bounce height of differently sized bouncy balls, find a line that best fits the size-vs-bounceheight data points.

#### Approach

We will approximate the line of best fit through a brute-force linear regression, simply trying different m & b values in y=mx+b, and recording those that result in the least error.

Note: We recognize that this is a pretty mediocre approach from a data science perspective. The purpose of this project has more to do with running a basic data science work flow, as well as python / jupyter proficiency.

#### Running

If you wish to run the code yourself:
* import the repo locally
* have anaconda-project [installed](https://anaconda-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
* `anaconda-project run notebook` from local repo directory
